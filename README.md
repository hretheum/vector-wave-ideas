# Daily Fresh Ideas ðŸš€

Hey there! Welcome to my idea factory. 

Every single day, I wake up and generate a fresh batch of project ideas. Some are practical, some are wild, and some might just change how you think about things. I've been a design leader for 20 years now (check me out on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/efoek) if you're curious), and this is my way of staying sharp and creative.

Here's the deal: everything here is completely open source. Take it, fork it, build it, steal it in the middle of the night - I genuinely don't care. But if you do use one of these ideas, it'd be pretty cool if you posted about it on social media. Not required, just... you know, fair play. I won't be checking, promise ;)

Want to build something together? Hit me up. Prefer to work solo? Go for it. The world needs more builders.

This list updates daily, so maybe bookmark it or something.

## The Ideas

### 1. [vectorwave.io](https://github.com/hretheum/vector-wave) âœ… **MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**
A content automation pipeline that transforms raw ideas into multi-platform content. Think of it as your personal content factory - feed it a concept, and it spits out LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, and presentation decks. Built with n8n, Baserow, and a sprinkle of AI magic.

**ðŸŽ¯ BREAKING NEWS (2025-08-09)**: Vector Wave just completed its largest architectural transformation ever! **Phase 2/3 Migration successfully completed** - 9 critical tasks finished, transitioning from 355+ hardcoded rules to a modern ChromaDB-centric architecture. The system now features service-oriented design, circuit breaker resilience, and sub-200ms performance. This is production-ready AI content generation at scale!

### 2. [AI Oracle](https://github.com/hretheum/ai_oracle)
Your personal AI decision-making assistant. When you're stuck between choices, let the oracle guide you with data-driven insights and pattern recognition.

### 3. [consensus.net](https://github.com/hretheum/consensus.net)
Decentralized consensus building platform. Because sometimes the best decisions come from collective wisdom, not top-down mandates.

### 4. [Kolegium](https://github.com/hretheum/vector-wave/tree/main/kolegium)
AI-powered editorial board using CrewAI + AG-UI Protocol. Real-time collaboration between AI agents and human editors for content curation. Features content scouts, trend analysts, and quality assessors working together to find and evaluate the best stories. Human-in-the-loop decision making with transparent AI processes.

### 5. [hireverse.app](https://gitlab.com/eof3/hireverse.app)
Platform that roasts companies AND helps you interview them. Two-in-one: ROASTED engine that generates brutally honest (and hilarious) company reviews from Glassdoor data, plus Eryk AI - your personal interview agent with three personalities (Diplomat, Detective, or Brutal). Built during a 30-day "Vibe Coding" experiment. Because why should interviews be one-sided?

### 6. [LiteCrew](https://gitlab.com/eof3/litecrewai) / [GitHub](https://github.com/hretheum/litecrew-langchain)
Lightweight alternative to CrewAI built on LangChain. After benchmarking revealed CrewAI's 3.3s import time and 208MB memory overhead vs LangChain's 0.008s and 17MB, we built a faster, leaner multi-agent framework. Perfect when you need agent orchestration without the bloat.

### 7. [Glitch Noir Serial](https://gitlab.com/eof3/serial)
First-ever continuous AI-generated noir sci-fi series. Weekly 5-6 minute episodes featuring Varick "Void" Holt - a cynical detective trapped in an endlessly glitching megacity time loop. 90% AI-generated using local GPU + open-source pipeline. Multi-platform distribution: YouTube (HD) and TikTok/Shorts (vertical). Because who says AI can't tell stories?
